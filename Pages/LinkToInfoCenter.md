### Link to InfoCenter
Simply send an email to jkadreamer at gmail dot com with the information below: <br>
1. Link to your video with verbal language<br>
The language doesn't have to be English only. Just inform to user before selection.<br>
YouTube or any you created, that is playable by regular web browser such as Chrome or Edge<br>
Ex) YouTube - internet address of your video on YouTube, that is displayed on the address bar on the browser.

2. Link to your Go file <br>
Allowed file type: SGF or GBF<br>
The file must be stored on such as Google Drive and shareable to public, so we can download.<br>
* SGF file is OK that is available like standard format for most of Go Game Editor.<br> 
* GBF file is recommended to build a link to your video and protect game information.

#### Create GBF file with Web link to your video
1. Set the board to Pän or Edit mode. <br>
2. Read the file you want to edit. It can be SGF or GBF file.
3. Click 'Edit information' button at left panel.<br>
   You might see that the information on the panel is not 100% compatible when SGF file is read in. Then, you have to check and fill the information  by yourself.
4. Add the link to your video at 'Web Link to Share'
5. Check 'Lock the information?' to protect the information in the panel.<br>
   Do NOT check this until you finalize the information, or you can not go back to edit.
   
After adding the web link, the board has to show the hyper link as specified below with red rectangle, and it has to open your video on web browser when you click it.
