Figure shows an example of a 'Life and Death' puzzle. White moves first, as initial condition, and is requested to capture the black stones.<br/>

User may try some moves over the given stone layout and consider the effective move sequence to achieve the request. When doing so, the given stone layout above has to keep its original form, and user only needs to add or remove stones on the board for evaluation. The found stone move sequence could be more than one and they all have to be recorded and reviewed. 

To get started, find the game title 'Life and dead in Regular form' from the top of the app combo box or from the InfoViewer, and read it. Assumed the sample file, Sample_GBF_1_File.gbf, is open in the app.
